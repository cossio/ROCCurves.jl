# ROCCurves

A simple and lightweight implementation of [ROC (Receiver operating characteristic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curves in Julia.

Exports the functions: `roc`, `auc`, `auc_roc` and `confusion_matrix`.
See their doc-strings for details, and the `example.jl` file for an usage example.
